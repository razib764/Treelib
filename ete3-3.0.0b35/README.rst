ETE (Environment for Tree Exploration is a Python programming
toolkit that assists in the automated manipulation, analysis and
visualization of phylogenetic trees. Clustering trees or any
other tree-like data structure are also supported. 

ETE is currently developed as a tool for researchers working in phylogenetics
and genomics. ETE provides specialized tools to reconstruct, compare and visualize
phylogenetic trees. If you use ETE for a published work, please cite:
